{"openapi":"3.0.0","servers":[{"description":"FastPix Video APIs","url":"https://v1.fastpix.io"}],"info":{"description":"Media APIs provides a set of API endpoints that enable developers to manage video and audio content on the FastPix platform. These endpoints are designed for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting media files, as well as handling metadata and playback settings. This functionality is crucial for any video-centric product or application that serves video on demand (VOD) or audio on demand (AOD) content, allowing developers to programmatically manage their media library.\n\n#### How media APIs work \n\n\nThese endpoints allow developers to automate the process of uploading media, managing playback permissions, and customizing the user experience. With the ability to create media from URLs, upload videos directly from devices, add audio or subtitle tracks, and manage playback IDs, developers can build scalable and flexible VOD solutions. The Media APIs ensure that content is easily accessible, customizable, and ready for distribution to users.\n#### Use case scenarios\n\n**Building a video-on-demand platform:** Developers can use these APIs to manage video libraries for streaming services, allowing users to watch content on demand. \n\n**Media management for e-learning platforms:** Instructors can upload lecture videos, update content metadata, and control playback settings for students using these endpoints. \n\n**Adding multiple language tracks to videos:** \n  Developers can append additional audio or subtitle tracks to media for a global audience, providing a personalized viewing experience. \n    ","version":"1.0.0","title":"VIDEO ON DEMAND API","contact":{"email":"support@fastpix.io"}},"tags":[{"name":"on-demand","description":"On-demand APIs"}],"paths":{"/on-demand":{"post":{"security":[{"BasicAuth":[]}],"tags":["Input video"],"summary":"Create media from URL","description":"This endpoint allows developers or users to create a new video or audio media in FastPix using a publicly accessible URL. FastPix will fetch the media from the provided URL, process it, and store it on the platform for use. \n\n\n\n#### Public URL requirement:\n\n\n  The provided URL must be publicly accessible and should point to a video stored in one of the following supported formats: .m4v, .ogv, .mpeg, .mov, .3gp, .f4v, .rm, .ts, .wtv, .avi, .mp4, .wmv, .webm, .mts, .vob, .mxf, asf, m2ts \n\n \n\n#### Supported storage types:\n\nThe URL can originate from various cloud storage services or content delivery networks (CDNs) such as: \n\n\n* **Amazon S3:** URLs from Amazon's Simple Storage Service. \n\n* **Google Cloud Storage:** URLs from Google Cloud's storage solution. \n\n* **Azure Blob Storage:** URLs from Microsoft's Azure storage. \n\n* **Public CDNs:** URLs from public content delivery networks that host video files. \n\nUpon successful creation, the API returns an id that should be retained for future operations related to this media. \n \n#### How it works\n \n\n1. Send a POST request to the /media endpoint with the media URL (typically a video or audio file) and optional media settings. \n\n2. FastPix uploads the video from the provided URL to its storage. \n\n3. Receive a response containing the unique id for the newly created media item. \n\n4. Use the id in subsequent API calls, such as checking the status of the media with the **Get Media by ID** endpoint to determine when the media is ready for playback. \n\nFastPix uses webhooks to tell your application about things that happen in the background, outside of the API regular request flow. For instance, once the media file is created (but not yet processed or encoded), we’ll shoot a POST message to the address you give us with the webhook event video.media.created. \n\n\nOnce processing is done you can look for the events video.media.ready and video.media.failed to see the status of your new media file.\n\n#### Use case scenario\n \n\n* **Use case:** A developer wants to integrate a user-generated content platform where users can upload links to their videos hosted on third-party platforms like AWS or Google Cloud Storage. This endpoint is used to create media directly from those URLs. \n\n\n* **Detailed example:** \nSay you’re building an online learning platform where instructors upload video URLs hosted on their private cloud servers. By providing the video URL to this endpoint, the platform processes and adds it to your media library, ready for playback. \n","operationId":"create-media","requestBody":{"content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"required":["playbackPolicy","accessPolicy","inputs"],"properties":{"inputs":{"type":"array","description":"The Input will consist of url, startTime, endTime, type, languageCode, name, and closedCaption.\n","items":{"type":"object","required":["url","type"],"properties":{"type":{"type":"string","example":"video","description":"Defines the type of input.

A user requests detailed information about a specific video to see if it has been fully processed and is available for playback. Using the media ID, you can fetch the information from FastPix and display it in the user’s dashboard. \n","operationId":"get-media","parameters":[{"in":"path","name":"mediaId","required":true,"schema":{"type":"string","format":"uuid","example":"4fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6"},"description":"The Media Id is assigned a universal unique identifier, which can contain a maximum of 255 characters."}],"responses":{"200":{"description":"Get a video media by id","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"success":{"type":"boolean","example":true,"description":"Demonstrates whether the request is successful or not."},"data":{"type":"object","properties":{"thumbnail":{"type":"string","example":"https://images.fastpix.io/6b13fdaf-f9ac-4970-a13b-01ea417e8783/thumbnail.png","description":"A video thumbnail is a still image that acts as the preview image for your video."},"id":{"type":"string","format":"uuid","example":"3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6","description":"When creating the media, FastPix assigns a universally unique identifier with a maximum length of 255 characters."},"workspaceId":{"type":"string","format":"uuid","example":"5ta85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6","description":"A unique identifier is generated by FastPix for the workspace."},"metadata":{"type":"object","example":{"key1":"value1"},"description":"You can search for videos with specific key value pairs using metadata, when you tag a video in \"key\" : \"value\" pairs.
